# RanchHand

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/ranch-hand.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/ranch-hand)

Provides a simple interface on top the Rancher CLI and the Kubectl commands to make running commands in pods easier.
This is particularily useful when using Kubernetes in a development environment.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'ranch-hand'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install ranch-hand

## Setup

Once ranch-hand is installed, run `ranch-hand setup` from the command line. This will create the necessary files in `~/.ranch-hand`.

#### Project setup

Project setup is optional. You can create a set of default values for certain flags by running `ranch-hand init` in any directory. When ranch-hand is run from a directory it will use the values in the `.ranch-hand` file if it is present.

Normally you might run the following command: `ranch-hand -n my-namespace -g -p my-project -c /bin/bash`
Using `ranch-hand init` you can set the namespace, grouping flag and pod name as defaults, and instead just run: `ranch-hand -c /bin/bash`.

## Usage

RanchHand makes use of the [GLI](https://github.com/davetron5000/gli) (Git Like Interface) gem to create a CLI with features similar to the Git CLI. Run `ranch-hand help` or `ranch-hand command help` for usage information.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
